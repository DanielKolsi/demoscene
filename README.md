Demoscene effects; mostly retro Amiga 1991 -> (DCS)

This project demonstrates some demoscene effects in Javascript (1986->) originally implemented using C64, Amiga (MC68k, Aga/Non-Aga) or PC x86.

Most of the effects implemented here are familiar especially during 1990-1997 from Amiga demoscene. I used to be active in DCS (Dual Crew Shining) in apx. 1996-2002.

These effects include but are not limited to:

1) different text scrolling (sinus etc.)
2) "copper" effects (colors!)
3) fractals (Julian & Mandelbrot sets etc.), http://acko.net/blog/how-to-fold-a-julia-fractal/
4) 2D image manipulation (blitter style), bobs...
5) 3D vectors, glenz & filled vectors
6) shading (gouraud, phong...)
7) env maps, bump maps etc.
8) some math + image processing
9) rendering, ray tracing etc.
10) image zoom + rotate 
11) plasma
12) voxels...
Bonus: some kind of storyline...
